# JollyView

JollyView is a screenshot snippet manager, meant to help manage screenshots of hints and solutions when playing Flash escape games.

## Instructions

Place the JollyView window on your desktop, next to the escape game window. Use Win+Shift+S to make screenshots of clues.
JollyView will monitor the clipboard and pick them up automatically.

Double-click with the left mouse button to open an image in full size.
Double-click with the right mouse button to hide an image, e.g. when you don't need the hint anymore.
Hidden images can be shown again through the `Actions` menu.
